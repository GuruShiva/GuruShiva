Now one would usually have one of the New Year's resolution is to start a blog about something. Once upon a time, it was on my list too. However, this time I decided to do mine one month before the year 2019. 

Why is my first post called "The Resurrection Of My Blog"? Well, because I did have a blog made out of WordPress and I have no idea where it is. I am sure it is not online (maybe?).

Why resurrect it at all you may ask for I am not an interesting person at all. Well (again), I have been actively partipating in communities for Information Security, Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence and so on. Sometimes I just happen to contribute something interesting which I would like to share with the rest of you. In the next coming posts, I hope to share some snippets of these.

Check out my [About Me](https://gurushiva.github.io/aboutme/) page.

Please bear in mind that this blog is still being worked on so forgive me if certain links/posts seems to be broken (it most likely is).

Until next time, stay safe and have fun.
