subtitle: What you didnt know about Hummus

My name is Guru Shiva. Some in the infosec and ML/AI community knows me as Hummus (mostly because I worship Hummus. I consider one with the Hummus).

My current role is that of a Security Analyst where I do Red Team. Blue Team, Hummus Team stuff. I also sm a machine learning/aritificial intelligence enthusiast.


### My Professional History

A brief view on what I have worked as:

- Systems Analyst
- Systems Administrator
- Technical Operations Manager
- Security Analyst (currently)

In all these roles, I have found myself to dabble in code( Python and web stuff mostly), network security etc.

P.S- I will eventually fill something exciting here.
